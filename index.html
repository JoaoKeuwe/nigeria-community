          <h2>About Us</h2>

          <p>
            The Nigerian Community in Brazil-NICOM (Communidade Unificada
            Nigeriana No Brasil) is an off-short of the defunct Student Union
            which was formed by Group of Nigerian Students who came from Nigeria
            to study at the University of São Paulo (USP) and other universities
            in Brazil. The first President of the Student Union was Dr. Lawrence
            Ifidon (1977-1983). After the Student Union came to an end; members
            of the Union and other Nigerians decided that it was high time to
            form an encompassing Organization consisting of Nigerians from all
            works of life residing in Brazil. <br />
            <br />
            A Constitution Committee was put in place (1986) and the members of
            the Committee elaborated a Constitution which was promulgated to
            guide the conduct of intending members. Under the auspices of His
            Excellency; Mr. Muntari Abdu Kaita, Consul General of the Consulate
            General in São Paulo, a reviewed edition of the constitution of
            NICOM was promulgated on the 12 of March 2015. The Constitution
            review committee was chaired by late Chief Eric lyke Agoha. The
            review had the intuition of rendering the Constitution more
            representative in promoting a better balance of power or equity
            between the office of President and other members of Executive.
            <br /><br />

            The supremacy of the Constitution was declared as sacrosanct, the
            Association was formed as a membership Organization and none profit
            oriented body. The first democratic elected President of the
            Nigerian Community in Brazil was Mr. Lawrence Balogun. At the end of
            his tenure, a caretaker Committee was instituted led by Mr. Joseph
            Ozugbo, he later conducted another democratic election which
            swore-in Mr. Beruck C. Nwabasili, his administration lasted for
            almost 9 years (1999-2008) (nine). Another election was conducted,
            this time Mr. Theodore C. Nwaike began his Presidency which lasted
            for almost 7 years (seven) (2008-2015) A third Democratic election
            was held on the 11 of July 2015. <br /><br />
            Dr. Emmanuel O.T Oluwatuyi was sworn-in as President of NICOM. His
            was sworn on the 1" of August 2015 and his tenure is still in
            progress for reasons what would be mentioned in the course of this
            Report. On the 13th of October 2018 a 7 member Committee was
            inaugurated by the President. They were given the mandate to
            organize and supervise a new Presidential election process that will
            usher a new dispensation of the Nigerian Community EXCO in Brazil.

            The trajectory traced by the Various Presidents who have Governed
            the Nigerian Community all led towards the same objective as
            enshrined in our Constitution: 1. To provide the necessary
            representation and to equip Nigerians with the basic orientation/
            knowledge of the socio-Political Milieu of Brazil. 2. To defend the
            fundamental human right of the Nigerian; to protect and guarantee
            his sovereign rights and duties within the confines of the Brazilian
            Society as defined in the Brazilian Constitution. 3. To provide
            Members with means to pursue and realize their individual economic
            sustenance through Job opportunities so that they could achieve
            their personal happiness. 4. To assist members in providing viable
            avenues to enhance their educational pursuits and to offer useful
            orientation in legitimate business or investments.
